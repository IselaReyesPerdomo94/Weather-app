## Assignment Instructions
* Please read all instructions before beginning the assignment

* We recommend using React (we included tooling to make this easier).
You are free, however, to select any framework you are comfortable with, or none at all.
* Clone this repo. **Do not commit, branch, or fork this repo.**
* The goal of this assignment is to create a simple weather web app using the metaweather Apis
* For the weather data, use the following hardcoded URL: https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/2367105/
* The app does not need to be interactive. When the page loads, it should query the weather API for Boston's weather.
The minimum and maximum temperature for the day should be displayed, as well as an icon for the weather and the location.
* We expect this assignment will take around 1-3 hours. You have **24 hours** from receipt of the assignment to submit your solution to us.
